# Russian-Roulette
Just a fun game I am making in c++ 

NOTES: Score and rounds are not yet working as of 4/24/23, I need to add functionality for it 

-- I will add a class to set size of revolver chamber from 1-6 to 
1/2/3/4/5-6


**********
-- add //declare who starts into a function called "startChecker();
